    "text": "About me:\nMy name is Afrooz Razi and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n\nResearch background:\nI earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2018. After graduation, I worked as a lab technician at Dr. Kevin S. McIver’s lab where I was introduced to genomics research. Pursuing this interest, I chose the Human Genetics and Genomics Ph.D. program in 2020 and was fascinated by the cutting edge research being done at Dr. Kasper D. Hansen’s lab. I joined the lab in 2021 and have been involved in multiple different projects since then. I am interested in understanding the effects of non-coding genetic variations on allelic imbalance. I hope that my contribution in research helps us with better understanding in the non-coding variations that result in common as well as rare diseases.\n\n\nInvolvement\n\nCo-organizer at R-Ladies Baltimore\nVolunteer at Bioconductor conference 2023\n\n\n\nContact:\narazi2@jhmi.edu"
