    "text": "About me:\nMy name is Afrooz Razi and I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n\nResearch background:\nI earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2018. After graduation, I worked as a lab technician at Dr. Kevin S. McIver’s lab where I was introduced to genomics research. Pursuing this interest, I chose the Human Genetics and Genomics Ph.D. program in 2020 and was fascinated by the cutting edge research being done at Dr. Kasper D. Hansen’s lab. I joined the lab in 2021 and have been involved in multiple different projects since then. I am interested in understanding the effects of non-coding genetic variations on allelic imbalance. I hope that my contribution in research helps us with better understanding in the non-coding variations that result in common as well as rare diseases.\n\n\nInvolvement\n\nCo-organizer at R-Ladies Baltimore\nVolunteer at Bioconductor conference 2023\n\n\n\nContact:\narazi2@jhmi.edu"

    "text": "For this section, I will investigate the crime dataset for few different cities across the US.\n\n\nI aim to answer the question: Which cities have highest crime rate? Is the crime rate higher depending on month/day/time?\nThis analysis can be useful for police department in these cities as well as tourists who are planning their holiday trips. With holidays around the corner, using this data analysis, the police department can assign more units to areas with higher crime rate to insure safety of visitors at the times where the crime rate tends to be higher.\nI found this data from an R package which includes data from here: https://osf.io/zyaqn/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI found this dataset via Google search for this

    "text": "For this section, I will investigate the crime dataset for few different cities across the US.\n\n\nI aim to answer the question: Which cities have highest crime rate? Is the crime rate higher depending on month/day/time?\nThis analysis can be useful for police department in these cities as well as tourists who are planning their holiday trips. With holidays around the corner, using this data analysis, the police department can assign more units to areas with higher crime rate to insure safety of visitors at the times where the crime rate tends to be higher.\nI found this data from an R package which includes data from here: https://osf.io/zyaqn/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI found this dataset via Google search for this
